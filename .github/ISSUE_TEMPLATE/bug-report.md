1. shiny pokemon (name? family? pokedex id?)
2. release date.
3. shiny image.

It is super helpful if you could paste the shiny pokemon url from pokeminers website.
e.q. https://pokeminers.com/gmexplore/#Pikachu_Copy_2019

You could delete all of above after you read them to create a new issue.Thanks~
